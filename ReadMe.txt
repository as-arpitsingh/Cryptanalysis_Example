#————— Following are the Libraries needed to be installed to run this application other then the ones already included under ‘dependencies’

pip install matplotlib
pip install tkinter
pip install pycrypto
pip install rsa
pip install numpy

#————— How to Launch the application
- Once all the dependencies have been install in the system, just run the script ‘gui.py’  in Python 3, like:
python3 gui.py


#————— How to Use
- The application prompts to the user for any wrong inputs.
- The application keeps the user informed of the status of processes, like..
- if the keys were successfully generated (RSA) and if the key was successfully accepted (DES)
- The Graph shows the performance of the various Cryptographic Algorithms implemented in this application.
